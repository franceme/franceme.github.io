However, static analysis tools are hardly integrated in CI/CD processes. One of the main reasons is that they are still timeand memory-expensive to apply after every single patch when developing a program. For solving this issue, incremental static analysis helps developers quickly obtain analysis results after …• Cites: ‪Incremental flow analysis through computational dependency …‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 1 new citation to articles by Coen De Roover","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
