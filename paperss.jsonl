The shared artifacts, ie, models, must be edited collaboratively to make iterative development work in large engineering teams. The typical non-real-time collaboration workflow consists of three phases: The collaborators create copies of the model; Each collaborator edits their variant (copy) of the model; The collaborators merge the edited models back into one. During the merge phase, conflicting changes …• Cites: ‪Branch use in practice: A large-scale empirical study of 2,923 …‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 5 new citations to articles by Xin Xia","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
