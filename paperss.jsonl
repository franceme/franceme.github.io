In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates semantic context and function interfaces …• Cites: ‪Gigahorse: thorough, declarative decompilation of smart contracts‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 1 new citation to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}

This thesis presents Heroes Arena, a fully decentralized real-time card battle game deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, designed to minimize user-perceived latency. By employing a parallel architecture that loads all necessary blockchain data upon user login and subsequently executes all gameplay …• Cites: ‪Madmax: Surviving out-of-gas conditions in ethereum smart contracts‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 2 new citations to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
