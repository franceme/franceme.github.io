Often the cost of using such languages is too high, due to the level of expertise required from the developers and challenges that they often face when trying to prove a program correct. Even though Dafny automates a lot of the …• Cites: ‪Code structure–guided transformer for source code summarization‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 9 new citations to articles by Xin Xia","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
