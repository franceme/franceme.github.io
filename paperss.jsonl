Such properties include modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc. This has motivated significant work on developing abstract domains to improve the precision and performance of sharing analyses. Much of this work has centered around the family of set-sharing domains, because of …• Cites: ‪Strictly declarative specification of sophisticated points-to analyses‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 5 new citations to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}

The implementation of features that are never used is often called bloat. With the growing complexity of software systems, which rely on an increasing amount of dependencies, the amount of bloat shipped tends to rise [25]. This bloat manifests primarily in increased artifact file size, a concern traditionally associated with embedded systems facing memory constraints. Recently, size has gained …• Cites: ‪Pointer analysis‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 5 new citations to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}

There are plenty of APIs to choose from—stream and sink, reader and writer, iterator and oopsmissing-counterpart. But these APIs typically vary between languages or libraries. Even within a single ecosystem, there often are inconsistencies between the processing models the different APIs induce.• Cites: ‪Stream fusion, to completeness‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 5 new citations to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
