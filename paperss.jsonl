However, after we deploy a smart contract in a blockchain, we cannot change, modify, or debug it. Further, wrong or vulnerable coding implementation in smart contracts could have error output that may have severe consequences in the future. Thus, the challenge of finding vulnerabilities in the smart contract is vital to stop criminals from performing malicious exploits during Defi transactions.
