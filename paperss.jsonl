While numerous tools are available for analyzing smart contracts in source code, only about 1.79% of smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source. For existing tools that target bytecodes, most of them only consider the semantic logic context and disregard function interface information in the bytecodes. In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates semantic context and function interfaces …• Cites: ‪Gigahorse: thorough, declarative decompilation of smart contracts‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 1 new citation to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
