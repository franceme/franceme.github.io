However, existing frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code, resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a vision that integrates LLMs …• Cites: ‪Precision-guided context sensitivity for pointer analysis‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 2 new citations to articles by Yannis Smaragdakis","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
