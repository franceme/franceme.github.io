There has been a surge of work on automatic code summarization to reduce the burden of writing summaries manually. However, contemporary approaches only leverage the information within the boundary of the method being summarized (ie, local context), and ignore the broader context that could assist with code summarization.

However, the security implications of RACG systems, particularly the risks posed by vulnerable code examples in the knowledge base, remain largely unexplored. This risk is particularly concerning given that public code …• Cites: ‪Opportunities and challenges in code search tools‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 10 new citations to articles by Xin Xia","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}

Recently, language model-based techniques have been developed to automate log generation based on input code. Although these methods demonstrate promising results in isolated evaluations, their effectiveness diminishes when applied to ad-hoc low-quality data and code similarity-based evaluation methods. We consider a comprehensive evaluation benchmark should …• Cites: ‪Which variables should i log?‬  ","AuthorName":"GScholar : 10 new citations to articles by Xin Xia","AuthorEmail":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en","PubDate":null}
